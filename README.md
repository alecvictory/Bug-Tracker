This application was made for creating and monitoring IT bugs for a company.

I utilized a VueJs front end implementing the Vue-Router and the AppState to manage the DOM. On the server side I used Express with Node.js. I implemented Auth0 for authentication, mongoose as an ORM and MongoDB as the database.
